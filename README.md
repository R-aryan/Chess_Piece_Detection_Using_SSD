# Chess Piece Detection Using SSD

# Cards Detection Using FASTER RCNN

- End to end object detection project using SSD(Single Shot Detection).
- The training is done using [TFOD2.0(Tensorflow object detection) framework](https://tensorflow-object-detection-api-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
- The application is served as an REST API using Flask.


# Steps to run the application 

### Setting up  virtual environment.

- What is [**Virtual Environment in python ?**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-virtual-environment/)
- [Create virtual environment in python](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/creating-python-virtual-environment-windows-linux/)
- [Create virtual environment Anaconda](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/set-up-virtual-environment-for-python-using-anaconda/)
- create a virtual environment and install [requirements.txt](https://github.com/R-aryan/Cards_Detection_Using_FASTER-RCNN/blob/develop/requirements.txt)
