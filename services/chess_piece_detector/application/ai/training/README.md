- The training notebook can be found [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1MBJ-LLIAKxWHqVZQYTKphrfei8H1PsOq?usp=sharing)
- The inference can be found [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/14aQNu0RgeLslQFH6VYhW59FJ_kVtMkFg?usp=sharing)
- Due to system/hardware limitations it was not possible to perform training locally.
- So google colab and google drive was used for training purpose.
- Although the TFOD(Tensorflow Object detection Framework) setup can be done locally on te machine.
- Steps to set up TFOD 2.0 can be found [here](https://tensorflow-object-detection-api-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
